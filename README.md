# Achtung, die Kurve

This is my take on a remake for "Achtung, die Kurve" (also known as "Zatacka" or just "Kurve").
My main goal was to learn and build something with HTML5 Canvas and without any libraries (for this case I don't count TypeScript :D )

Maybe I will add some funny game-modes or extensions in the future.
