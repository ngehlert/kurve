# Achtung, die Kurve

This is my take on a remake for "Achtung, die Kurve" (also known as "Zatacka" or just "Kurve").
My main goal was to learn and build something with HTML5 Canvas and without any libraries (for this case I don't count TypeScript :D )

Maybe I will add some funny game-modes or extensions in the future.

## Demo

Head over to [https://kurve.ngehlert.de](https://kurve.ngehlert.de) if you are interested in playing

## Get it running

1.  Check out repository
2.  Open _public/index.html_

## Get it running developer style

1.  Check out repository
2.  `npm install`
3.  `npm run build`
4.  Open _public/index.html_

## Development

`npm run dev:w`

Will enable watch mode and constantly rebuild project on changes

## Electron

`npm run start-electron`

Will build an electron version and start up the app
